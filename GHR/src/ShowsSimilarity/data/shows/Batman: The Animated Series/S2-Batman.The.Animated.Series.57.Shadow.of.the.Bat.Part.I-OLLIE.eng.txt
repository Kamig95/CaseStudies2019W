This place gives me the willies.
No kidding. Why do we gotta do this stuff in the middle of the flipping night?
Maybe you'd prefer moving contraband in broad daylight...
...when the cops might notice.
Jeez, boss. You shouldn't sneak up on guys like that.
Just get this stuff loaded.
I never liked this place.
This is the police.
We have you surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
I can't be seen here. Hold them off.
That's right, nice and easy.
Hey!
I never liked this place.
Come on, then. You're not taking
Rupert Thorne without a fight.
You.
If I gotta go down,
I'm taking you with me.
Careful, Gil.
Don't make this hard on yourself, Thorne.
Step out where we can see you.
Not even if I could, flatfoot.
Look.
Don't you just love it when he gives them to you giftwrapped?
<i>The deputy commissioner, Gil Mason, who last night was instrumental...</i>
<i>... in capturing Rupert Thorne.</i>
<i>Mason attributed the incriminating evidence against Thorne to a mysterious informant.</i>
<i>And the commissioner and I won't rest until every crime kingpin...</i>
<i>... hustler and two-bit crook is off the streets.</i>
You'll ruin your eyes changing channels so fast, Master Bruce.
Not to mention your attention span.
One would think the fall of Rupert Thorne would bring a smile even to your face.
I'd love to know who this mysterious informant is.
This is the third ganglord Mason's brought down in as many months.
Yes, it's quite alarming.
If this continues, you might even be forced into taking a vacation.
You know, Dad, if you and Gil keep nailing bad guys like this...
...people will think you two are Batman and Robin.
What can I say? Gil is a godsend.
- And he's not bad-looking, either.
- Dad.
I just got you to stop treating me like a kid...
...and now you're trying to marry me off.
Don't think I didn't see you two at that fundraiser last week.
Thick as thieves, you were.
Mr. Mason, you must be psychic.
We were just talking about you.
Come in. Come in.
- Hey, Gil. What's doing?
- Another tip on a case?
Believe me, Jim,
I don't wanna be here.
But I thought it would be best coming from me.
What is it? What's wrong?
James Gordon, I have a warrant for your arrest.
This is a joke, right?
- On what charges?
- Accepting bribes.
You can't be serious.
The department has reason to believe...
...that you've been taking money from Rupert Thorne for years.
What? Dad's never taken a bribe in his life.
I'm sorry, Barb.
You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, anything you say...
I know my rights, Gil.
Dad.
Don't worry, Barbara.
It's all a mistake, you'll see.
Commissioner, do you have a statement?
I'm sorry, Barbara. I really am.
Commissioner Gordon, just a statement.
What about these corruption charges?
Ms. Gordon, do you have a statement?
We'll see about this.
But you're the DA, Janet.
You've worked with my father.
- There must be something you...
- The evidence is solid, Barbara.
Money deposited to your father's name in laundered accounts...
...witnesses who swear they saw him take bribes.
- That's not sufficient cause to deny bail.
- True. But we also found deposit receipts...
...for a South American bank.
We have to consider him a flight risk.
This is crazy. My father would never...
Maybe you don't know your father as well as you think.
Maybe none of us do.
Don't you believe her, kid.
Your pop's the best there is.
That's why the department's putting on a rally for him.
- Harvey, that's a wonderful idea.
- Yeah. Wish I could say it was mine.
Just because I have a job to do doesn't mean I'm not on your side.
I'm going to see Jim Gordon gets all the public support we can muster.
All the top cops will be there, including yours truly.
So don't worry your pretty little head.
It should be quite a show.
Yes, and I know someone who'd be a real showstopper, if I can get him.
I was wondering when you'd get around to me.
I got a look at the evidence. Those deposit receipts were perfect forgeries...
...dated months ago.
Doesn't look like Thorne's handiwork.
- Then who?
- Word on the street is...
...a new syndicate is moving in.
Could be a connection. I'll check it out.
<i>- Anything you need?
- Yes. Check on Barbara.</i>
Keep her out of this.
But you have to come to the rally.
The public respects you. If they see you there, they'll know Dad's innocent.
Sorry, but there's more to this than a simple frame-up.
And I'm not gonna find out by appearing at rallies.
- But don't you see?
- The best thing you can do for him...
...is to keep out of it.
The people behind this are dangerous.
"I'm a professional, don't try this at home," huh? Sorry, Batman.
You being at the rally could decide if Dad goes free.
So you'll be there, one way or another.
- You called me, boss?
- The rally's tomorrow night.
Everything's in place.
You know what to do.
Will you at least wear a transceiver? I can monitor from here in case they try to...
- No, too easy to detect.
- Hey. I didn't miss a Bogart festival...
...in film class just to sit on my butt here while you hit the streets.
There has to be something I can do.
Do you make public appearances?
After all Commissioner Gordon has done for Gotham City...
...the least the city can do for him is grant him bail.
Showtime.
Bruce? What in...?
- That's him, all right.
- It's Batman.
- I knew it.
- He knows Gordon's innocent!
Grandstanding psycho.
Touchdown.
And the crowd goes wild.
What the...?
Wait!
A girl?
The lady's with me, gents.
Are you crazy?
You're lucky you didn't get killed.
- Come on. They're getting away.
- This is nuts.
Great. She's gone too.
Funny, I don't remember a Batgirl in our little club.
<i>All Gotham is talking about the mysterious Batgirl...</i>
<i>... who foiled an assassination attempt on acting Commissioner Gil Mason.</i>
Expanding membership in the crime-fighting club?
If I find out who she is, I'll...
Hey. Look at that.
Mr. Mason ducked before he saw the guns.
Almost as though he expected it.
Batgirl, sheesh. What's next,
Weasel Woman?
Gotcha.
Gil, you know those guys who shot at you?
Well, I think I know who one of...
- Something wrong, Barbara?
- I didn't know you had company.
Oh, no problem.
My friend here was just leaving.
Oh, yeah. Gotta run. Listen, I'll see you at the business meeting, Gil.
Miss.
So welcome to my humble abode.
I just came over to...
To see if you're okay.
I was worried about you.
Hey, I appreciate that.
I really do. Drink?
Oh, I'm sorry, I was just on my way to see Dad.
But I'm sure I'll catch you again.
Yeah, boss, like Batman, only a dame.
She almost screwed up everything.
Don't worry. No one can hear me.
Right, boss. I'm heading back right now.
What am I gonna do? If Gil's involved in this, there's nobody I can trust.
And if Batman's not around...
What do you think, Woobie?
Could use a little work, huh?
It appears we have a prowler.
Who are you? What are you doing here?
Matches Malone. Heard about a new mob.
- Thought I could make some more dough.
- Is that so?
Well, you heard right.
In fact, you can double your take on the jobs we're pulling...
...assuming I let you live to join my gang.
Matches Malone, huh?
Never heard of you.
But there's something about you that I don't like.
Nothing I can put my finger on, but I trust my hunches.
Kind of like second sight, you know?
Good heads, you live. Bad heads, you don't.
Simple, huh?
So Batman can't help me? Fine.
In that case, let's see what Batgirl can do.
