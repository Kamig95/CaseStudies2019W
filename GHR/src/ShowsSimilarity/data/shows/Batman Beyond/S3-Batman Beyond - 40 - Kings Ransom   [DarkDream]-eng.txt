[BEEPING SOFTLY]
KING:
Hurry, we haven't got all night.
Cut me some slack.
This used to be Ten's job, remember?
I told you, never mention her name again!
Never!
Ow!
[ALARM BLARING]
I suppose that's my fault too?
Stop it, both of you.
Have you forgotten why we're here?
We've got to finish the job before we attract any more attention.
[GLASS BREAKING]
Too late.
[GRUNTING]
[GRUNTING]
No.
Let's go.
[GROANING]
[GRUNTING]
Jack. We can't leave him.
[SIRENS APPROACHING]
There's nothing we can do for him now.
But--
Come on.
They tossed you in the discard pile, Jack.
So talk to me.
Lady, if you think
I'm gonna fold, you're not playing with a full deck.
All I'm asking is who were you working for?
Who says we were working for anyone?
Your family's taste in art has always run toward the Rococo,
Louis XIV.
This sudden interest in Pre-Columbian doesn't fit.
What do I know about art?
You'll have to ask Daddy.
He knows everything.
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like to be shown to my room.
I could use a little time to myself.
Sounds kind of chilly in the house of cards.
<i>You think Gordon's right?</i>
They were definitely working for someone.
And I have a pretty good idea who.
Thank you, Miss Thorpe.
So?
As promised... the Jaguar of the Fedazar.
Exquisite.
You're quite the connoisseur,
Mr. Powers.
I developed an eye for it when Father exiled me to South America.
Our agreement was payment on delivery.
Wait. What's this?
There was a bit of trouble during the getaway.
I'm not paying for damaged goods.
It was unavoidable.
No deal.
My son's rotting in jail because of that trinket.
We risked our lives.
You'll pay or--
[GRUNTING]
[GROANS]
[SCREAMS]
I don't like threats.
Still, I suppose you should get something for your trouble.
Take it or leave it.
And you accepted this pittance?
What choice did I have?
This never would have happened if my father was still king.
Here we go.
Working for reprobates like Powers was beneath him.
He had class and made sure we were treated like royalty.
We've just had a run of bad luck, that's all.
Is it?
Look at us.
Ten is gone.
Jack's in jail.
And Ace?
We can barely repair him anymore.
Maybe it's time to fold our hand.
No.
It's not over.
Give me one good reason not to walk away.
Because I need you.
And because I have a trump that can't fail.
One that will put the Royal
Flush Gang back on top.
POWERS:
There's nothing like a rubdown after a hard day of corporate raiding.
Yes, Mr. Powers.
KING:
That will be all, Miss Thorpe.
What?
[GRUNTS]
[GRUNTING]
We need to follow up on our recent transaction,
Mr. Powers.
Please, don't hurt me.
I'll give you anything you want.
Indeed you will.
MAN 1:
Clear off Table 7.
MAN 2:
I'm still waiting on a salad.
MAN 3:
Where's Table 5's meat loaf?
ANCHOR [OVER TV]:
<i>In this breaking news,</i>
<i>Wayne/Powers CEO</i>
<i>Paxton Powers</i>
<i>has reportedly been abducted.</i>
<i>Officials refuse to comment,</i>
<i>but inside sources say</i>
<i>that the notorious</i>
<i>Royal Flush Gang</i>
<i>may be involved.</i>
<i>Long the scourge of Gotham,</i>
<i>the gang has most recently</i>
<i>been involved</i>
<i>in a number of art heists</i>
<i>around town.</i>
<i>As of this moment, there have</i>
<i>been no ransom demands.</i>
You okay, Mel?
<i>And police are intensifying</i>
<i>their search for the CEO.</i>
I need some air.
[DOG BARKING]
[SIGHS]
Can I get that to go?
Look, I haven't talked to my parents in months.
I had nothing to do with that Powers business.
I know. But if you should hear anything--
I won't.
As far as they're concerned,
I don't exist.
I'm sorry.
Wait, you remember that note I gave you?
The one for Terry McGinnis?
Did he...?
Yeah, he got it.
I guess I don't exist to him either.
POWERS:
Please, be reasonable. I--
I'm no good to you dead.
KING:
I think 20 million is more than reasonable for your continued good health.
I told you, I don't have it.
[GASPING]
Stop stalling.
You're the head of a major multinational corporation.
But my assets are tied up in investments.
I-- I live on company perks.
You're saying you have no money?
What now, my King?
TERRY:
It's almost midnight.
Patience.
[RINGING]
[GROWLS SOFTLY]
Wayne here.
KING: <i>Mr. Wayne,</i>
<i>I'm sure you're aware</i>
<i>of your company's present</i>
<i>predicament.</i>
But I'm a fair man.
You can have your president back for a mere 20 million credit.
No deal.
Perhaps you didn't understand.
<i>If you don't pay, we'll be</i>
<i>forced to dispose of him.</i>
I understand perfectly.
But it's against company policy to pay terrorists or kidnappers.
<i>Ask Paxton.</i>
<i>He wrote the policy.</i>
Uh, Bruce?
You're--? You're not really gonna--?
Relax, it's not over.
[SARCASTICALLY]
Brilliant.
Another plan that can't fail.
[NORMAL VOICE]
Father was right about you.
Oh, he had you pegged.
Shut up!
You're nothing but empty bluff.
You think I'm bluffing?
[ANGRILY]
You think I'm bluffing?
No, wait. I-- I do have some valuables, Gold and jewels.
Ah, the pustule pops.
The Crown of Takal, it's worth twice what you're asking.
[GRUNTS]
Where is it?
At home.
Lovely.
Place must be swarming with security by now.
How can we get in?
I could send my assistant,
Miss Thorpe.
Splendid.
What's her number?
QUEEN: No.
I don't trust her or anyone else close to him.
Them whom do you suggest, my love?
[RINGING]
Wayne here.
Good news, old man.
You can still save Powers' skin,
<i>and it won't cost your company</i>
<i>a single credit.</i>
Whoa.
Look familiar?
I always knew Paxton had this collection.
I just didn't know where he kept it.
There, the Crown of Takal.
It disappeared from a museum in Mexico City three years ago.
Are you sure you wanna ransom this creep?
It's my move.
I'm just sweetening the pot.
[RINGS]
You have it?
Excellent, Mr. Wayne.
We'll meet you.
Congratulations, Paxton.
Your investments have paid off.
Yeah, right.
You don't seem too happy.
Happy about going to jail?
Wayne hates me.
When he tells the district attorney about my collection,
I'll be locked up for years.
Unless...
KING:
What?
Unless Wayne was dealt out of the game.
Then my secret would be safe.
I'd have access to millions in company credits, and I'd be in a position to show my gratitude.
Are you saying...?
Yes.
Eliminate Wayne.
Are you in position?
BATMAN:
Yeah.
Here they come.
Wait for my signal.
The whites of their eyes, right?
[GRUNTING]
[GASPING]
Common hired killers.
I don't like it.
Then leave it to me.
You have the ransom,
Mr. Wayne?
Now bring him down.
What's your hurry?
Our business is done.
Not quite.
[GRUNTS]
Move in...now.
[GRUNTS]
[SCREAMS]
[GRUNTS]
[GROANING]
Checkmate, Mr. Wayne.
Sorry, Mr. Wayne, but the money's too good to pass up.
[FINGERS SNAP]
[BARKING]
[GASPS]
[GROANING]
Get him off!
I can't get a clear shot.
[GRUNTS]
[GRUNTS]
[GRUNTING]
[GRUNTING]
[GRUNTING]
[BOTH GRUNTING]
King!
[GROWLING]
Guess he decided to cut his losses.
He wouldn't.
He couldn't.
He did.
Good boy.
What kept you?
They had an Ace in the hole.
Luckily, so did I.
POWERS:
Help. Get me down.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Cut me loose.
[GRUNTS]
You wanna give me a concussion?
Maybe.
KING:
Exquisite.
It's everything that fool said it would be.
THORPE: I told you.
Darling.
And the rest of his collection is in the car.
Mm.
You work quickly, my dear.
[CHUCKLES]
It was child's play after he gave you the security codes.
Yes, everything turned out perfectly.
We've got Paxton's priceless collection, and he can't report it missing without compromising himself.
And your Queen?
So sad.
I wonder how long she'll rot in her dungeon before she realizes no one's coming to her rescue.
Not long.
[GRUNTS]
Queen.
Now, now, my dear, I--
I could explain.
Explain what?
That you're a lying philanderer?
That you destroyed our family?
That I've wasted the best years of my life on you?
[GRUNTING]
Don't you just hate these family squabbles?
Nothing I ever did was good enough for Your Royal Highness.
[GRUNTS]
[GRUNTS]
Well, I want out, and no one's gonna stop me.
[GRUNTING]
You fool.
You led him right to us.
[GASPS]
[GRUNTING]
Have you flipped your crown?
I couldn't stand it anymore.
[GRUNTS]
The constant comparison.
Do you have any idea what it's like living in someone's shadow?
[SCREAMS, GRUNTS]
Actually, I can relate.
Okay, Jack, you're outta here.
What?
Someone made your bail.
[FINGERS SNAP]
Melanie.
I made a lot of salads to pay for this.
You shouldn't have.
Hey, we're family, okay?
I got a job for you.
A real job.
That is, if you don't mind washing dishes.
Are you kidding?
I was the best dishwasher in juvie hall.
POWERS:
Kill Bruce Wayne?
They're lying, I tell you.
Bruce Wayne's my mentor.
He's like a father to me.
Except he doesn't glow in the dark.
Hey, I resent that.
Where's my lawyer? I'll sue.
I'll own this place when I done with you.
Let's get out of here.
You're all gonna work for the Sanitation
Department!
