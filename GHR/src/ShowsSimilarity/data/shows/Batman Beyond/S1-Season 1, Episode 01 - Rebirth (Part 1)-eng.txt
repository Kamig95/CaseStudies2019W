Thank you.
Thank you.
I saw you smile.
Yes I did, yes I did.
What do you want?
-Payment for the joke you bought.
I give you funny, you give me money.
I didn't buy anything!
Ah, your shy.
It's ok.
I'll just help myself.
Get lost, clown!
Big man.
That does it!
Jokers.
If the coach had us do one more lap,
I'd be sprouting gills.
Nelson! Nelson!
Nelson! Nelson!
Sounds like Nelson's got his monkeys rooting for him again.
Who's the victime this time?
Terry?
Just do it!
You got 'em! You got 'em!
My money's on Nelson.
Wouldn't be too sure, Chelsey.
-You've never wrestled with 'em.
Fold, Trey.
I got you beat.
Funny.
You reminde me of a Joker
I meet this morning.
Except he was prettier.
Oh, boy.
Not again.
That's it, McGinnis!
Get your clothes and get out!
But he just...
-But nothin'!
I saw you throw the first punch!
Out!
Research, McGinnis.
<i>Warren, it's Harry.</i>
Can you meet me on the landing, right away?
<i>Sure.
Everything all right?</i>
I'll explane, when I see you.
Harry?
You look slagged.
-Never mind that.
Here, keep this for me.
What's wrong with your hand?
-Nothing!
Warren, if anything should happen to me...
There you are, Mr. Telly.
You're late with your meeting with Mr. Powers.
Harry!
Come back here!
What's wrong with him?
I asked you here, Warren, to clear up any misconception you might have gotten from that incident with Mr. Telly.
Harry simply suffered an alergic reaction to a chemical compound in the lab.
Shook 'em up a bit, but he's under the best of care.
That's great.
When can I see him?
Monday morning, first thing.
Thank you, Mr. Powers.
-Don't mention it, Warren.
Oh, Warren.
Before I forget.
There seems to be a file missing from Harry's records.
Would you know where it is?
No, sir.
I have no idea.
No, of course not.
Harry, what were you working on?
Powers can't be serious.
He must be out of his mind to think...
-Knock, knock.
Terry, I'm busy.
Dad, I got to go out.
-You're grounded, remember?
I didn't start the fight!
-I'll hear all about it, when we meet with your consular.
Again.
Mom would hear me out!
-Your not living with your mom!
Don't remind me!
That's your problem, right there!
You can't control you temper and you'd better, if you expect to get anywhere in life.
Yeah, I'll be a big success.
Just like you.
I'm bailin'.
Terry...
Hey, I though you were in solitary?
I gave myself a time off for good behaviour.
I'm glad.
Don't go messin' things up again.
Evenin', boys and girls!
Who's up for some laughs?
You're not smiling.
Knock it off!
-I would, if you'd hold still.
Oh, chear up, sweetness.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Stop.
-Hands off!
I knew McGinis was a freak job.
Oh, no!
Fun time!
Get out of here!
Hurry!
The no-fun boy had an accident.
Let's put a smile on his face.
Leave him alone.
And get of my property.
You're trespassing.
Oh, is that right.
It's ok.
I can handle this.
Who do you think you're talkin' to, old man.
We're the Jokerz.
Sure you are.
Come on!
Man, you're somethin'.
I've never seen anyone...
Are you ok?
My medicine.
At the house.
Down, Ace!
He's ok.
Nice dog.
Not really.
Here you go.
The pills were right where you said.
Well then, I guess your gonna rest now, huh?
You go right ahead.
My dad's probably waitin' for me anyway.
I'll just let myself out.
Hope you feel better, Mr....
On second though, maybe I should give my dad a call.
Here's where I'm grounded for life.
A bat?
I'll get you out of there, just don't bite me.
No wonder he could fight.
Get out!
All right, I'm goin'!
It's not like I did anything wrong.
Freak.
Dad?
Oh, my god.
Terry!
Your ok.
Mom, what happened?
-A robbery.
The police say, it's the Jokerz.
They surprised your father.
Where is he?
Where's dad?
Honey, I...
Dad?
Dad!
<i>McGinnies leaves behind two sons, seeing here with his former wife, Mary.</i>
<i>Among the mourners was McGinnises employer,</i>
<i>Derek Powers.
I pledge to use whatever influence I have,</i>
<i>to see, that these creatures pay for there horrible act.</i>
It was about dad.
I know, hun.
Why don't you get ready for bed, ok.
Ok.
That friend of yours,
Dana, called.
She left her number.
Have you eaten anything yet?
Ter, you haven't said a word all day.
Don't you wanna talk?
Why would he open the door, mom?
What?
They were Jokerz.
He would't opened the door, he would've looked first!
How they traced me back to 'em?
Honey, we don't know, if it the same gang?
You've gotta stop...
-I should have been there!
I could've helped 'em!
I could've done something!
No.
Yes!
I'm not afraid of those guys.
We could've fought 'em off, me and dad!
We could've fought...
I yelled at 'em, mom.
He grounded me and I wouldn't listen.
The things I said.
I'm such a jerk.
Hurry up!
I'm opening as fast as I can.
You're some help, you know that.
It's not my junk.
I guess, that's my fault too.
In the event of my death or disappearance.
What you got?
Something dad was lookin' at.
Boring!
Tell mom I had to go.
I could be late.
Where you goin'?
<i>Out.</i>
Yeah, looks like we got lucky.
If you just keep on this road, it curves back to the freeway.
I can't leave you out here.
Sure you can.
I just have to see this guy.
About what?
I'll explane later.
You better go, before the storm hits.
Go!
Come on,
I know you're in there!
Listen to me!
Something stinks in your company!
I think it cost my old man his life!
The answer's on this!
I'd take it to the cops, but you know how cosy they are with Powers!
How about you takin' a look?
Yeah, I should have know, you wouldn't care!
You're no Batman, you wacked out old fraud!
Back off, Scooby.
It's me.
