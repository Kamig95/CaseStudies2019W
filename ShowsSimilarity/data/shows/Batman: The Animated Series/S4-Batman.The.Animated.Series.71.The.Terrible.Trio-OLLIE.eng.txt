A valiant effort, stout sentinel...
...but the game was ours afore it began.
Time to fly.
Wait, gentlemen.
So, what do they pay you here, Henry?
Nine, 10 dollars an hour?
A grand total of, what, four, 425 a week?
- Fox, come on!
- Let's see.
That'd be 21,000 a year.
Can that be right?
Here. In appreciation for services rendered.
- We won't tell.
- Beats a gold watch.
It's business decisions like that that got you where you are today.
Come, gentlemen. Let us away.
Did you hear that?
Allow me.
Don't worry about me. Get them!
Itï¿½ll be a pleasure.
Hate to tell you, but the costume party's over.
You want me, Tweety Bird?
Come on, then.
Robin! Stop!
He smells it.
Plan B, then.
Robin!
See? I told you this would be fun.
The Terrible Trio strikes again.
And the masks?
They look like refugees from Mardi Gras.
Predators of land, sea and air.
Maybe they're experts in those areas.
The only thing these guys are experts in is arrogance.
Thanks, Kevin.
Pull!
"Thanks, Kevin"?
Awfully chummy with the help, Bruce.
Do you thank the garbage man for picking up your trash?
If I happen to run into him.
Don't get Warren started, Bruce.
You know how he feels about the servants.
Gunther, Army, please.
I'm just trying to protect Bruce from his baser instincts.
Pull!
So this is all you do for kicks, Bruce?
Charity work?
Well, I do have a nightlife.
Pull!
Besides, it's important to help others.
It may sound corny, but, hey, it's how I feel.
But you must recognize that you are a superior animal, Bruce.
A member of the elite. Pull!
Take my Delta brothers and me.
Why, we've run with the bulls.
Shot game from hot-air balloons.
Killed a great white.
We've done it all.
Therein lies the problem.
After all, what do the rajahs do when there are no more tigers to hunt?
I'm sure you'll think of something,
Warren.
Dollar for dollar, that has to be the dullest man in Gotham City.
It should be obvious even to you,
Rebecca.
That dress is not appropriate attire.
Oh, Father, you just don't quit, do you?
Sheldon, nice to see you here.
The pleasure's all ours, Bruce.
Rebecca and I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
- Isn't that right, dear?
- Right.
Excuse me.
Children.
I thought you'd never finish that stupid game.
Careful, darling, Pater is watching.
He's always watching.
If you think he's mad now, wait until he gets this month's credit card bill.
And how much did that little frock set "Daddums" back?
Five thousand.
I'd say it was worth it.
I don't know how I'm gonna tell him.
Oh, Warren, you are a lifesaver.
It's only money.
With Daddy leaving town, I should be able to slip this into his account, no problem.
Catch you in the pool.
Old man, I'd say that fluttering sound you hear...
...is your check sprouting wings and flying away.
Actually, I thought that Daddy might be willing to reimburse me.
Oh, well, Ming was a boring dynasty anyway.
I don't know about this.
It's one thing to steal from strangers, but we know Fallbrook.
Yes, adds a bit of extra spice, doesn't it?
Hands up!
She said he'd be out of town.
Hello, police? This is Sheldon Fallbrook at the Gotham Park Towers.
I want to report...
That's where you belong, old man.
At my feet.
Come on.
The police will be here any minute.
<i>All units, possible robbery in progress...</i>
<i>... at Gotham Park Towers,
28th floor residence.</i>
I presume a good time was had by all?
Warren, it's him.
Have a little backbone, Army.
My turn.
He's hooked us!
- I can't shake him.
- What'll we do?
- Quick! Dump the money!
- What?
Dump the money! Now!
Hey, free money.
Aced it!
And once again, we owe it all to the little people.
Daddy?
Daddy, can you hear me?
I'm so sorry.
You might as well go on home, Ms. Fallbrook.
No telling when your father will come out of this.
Bruce. It's nice of you to come.
If there's anything I can do, Rebecca...
Warren.
I came as soon as I heard.
My poor Becky.
Dreadful business. So senseless.
Come, let me take your mind off this.
<i>Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor in the main lobby.</i>
You know, Becks, I don't think you should be alone right now.
The fellows and I were thinking about the mountains this weekend.
A change of scenery might do you good.
So the police still have no idea who the thieves are?
No, I guess not.
But I hope they find them soon.
I really shouldn't be here.
I mean, what if my father wakes up?
Come off it, Rebecca. Anyone would think you actually liked the old coot.
Well, he is my father.
We left the number here with the hospital.
And we're only an hour's drive from the city.
Well...
Time for a feast.
We're going to cheer you up whether you like it or not.
You're too sweet.
It's Dad's stick pin. How did it...?
No.
According to the computer...
...this is probably the ring that made the mark on Fallbrook's jaw.
It belongs to a frat,
Delta Sigma Alpha, mostly rich boys.
Like Warren Lawford and his Delta brothers.
All three of them inherited family fortunes.
Lawford gets his from oil...
...Lydecker's father owned an aerodynamics firm...
...and Hardwick's father was a shipping magnate.
Land, air and water.
It can't be a coincidence.
Scoundrels like these are worse than the Joker.
At least he's got madness as an excuse.
But they've got more money than the mint. Why would they steal?
Because we were bored!
Don't you get it? It was a game.
- A game?
- We've done everything else.
Treasure hunts, safaris, deep-sea diving.
We wanted a new challenge.
You know, the thrill of the chase.
And we were good at it.
We outfoxed the police and the Batman.
But the people you hurt, my father...
We never meant to hurt him, Becky. Really.
Of course not.
And we'll pay him back.
Sure we will.
Hey, we'll pay everybody back.
- You won't tell anyone, right?
- No. Oh, no, of course not.
- You'll tell.
- No, Warren. I won't, really.
She's a liability, one we can't afford.
Timeout, old man. This is getting extreme. There are limits to...
Haven't you listened to anything I've told you?
We are beyond limitations!
Beyond restriction!
She's your girlfriend, for crying out loud.
She's a spoiled, willful child.
And if we let her go...
...she will tell.
- You're out of your minds, all of you!
In for a penny, in for a pound.
Warren, for pity's sake.
Enough, Army!
I want this done with, now!
- Take over.
- Sure, leave me to steer with a broken arm.
Let's go, Fox.
You've raided your last chicken coop.
Wait, wait a minute. We can make a deal.
A million dollars to let me go.
Ten million!
Think about it. Buys a lot of Batarangs.
Your money's no good here.
Okay, fine.
Go ahead. Take me in, hero.
I've got every judge in town in my pocket.
You'll see. I'll get justice, the best that money can buy!
