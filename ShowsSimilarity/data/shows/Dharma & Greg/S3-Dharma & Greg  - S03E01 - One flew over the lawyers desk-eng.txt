I can not believe that love with the Prosecutor of the year! 
Western region second district, department B! 
Believe it, baby! 
Can you give away the secret? 
-I almost turned into lice. 
When I was a little girl, I would lay 
Official paper of the lawyer's chambers and cut out pictures sexy lawyers like you. 
I do not blame you, all girls do. 
Kiss me. First- show me the plaque. 
I'll help you, it is not easy. 
-Usually a man. 
But does not the prosecutor, the Western region, other district ... -Department B! 
Registering in person. Removes us 
Award-winning Prosecutor Mr. Montgomery. 
G. Montgomery, obviously you have a talent for porn stars. 
Why did you choose the right one? 
-Traditional reasons. 
Fans, free blocks. 
Behind every great man stands sex and free office supplies. 
I do not remember when I decided to become a lawyer. 
Because you have enough blood to the brain. 
Many have asked me this question, but 
I never thought about it. 
You're welcome now to begin? 
I'll show you a trick with buttons. 
Whole life is something 
I do, and I do not know why.

I would answer something without connections.

How can we be sure of anything? 
This is the table because it is so we call it. 
This is because we all agree with that. 
You do not want casual clothes on Fridays? 
I do not want to live unexplored life. -Then you're for casual Friday? 
Ooops. What have I missed? 
-G. Clayborn opened the meeting. 
Mr. Webster wants a casual Friday, and 
Buzz Aldrin flew to the moon. 
I'm glad you're here. 
Do not help him!

Now comes the a beautiful butterfly. 
So is gay? 
Would never wondering why are we doing?

<i> Come in, Greg. It's raining. </i> 
Why not be:

Because it is raining, Greg. Come! 
I thought I'll at least

Yes. If there are no other questions ...
